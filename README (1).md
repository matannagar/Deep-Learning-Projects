# NLP-and-Deep-Learning
---

**Goals:** <br>
Understanding the deep learning architecture, including working with images and series. <br>
A regression model in which a number is predicted and a classification model in which a class to which the item belongs is predicted. <br>
Basic concepts in natural language processing. <br>
The course is given at a level that is also compatible with graduate students.
