# NLP-and-Deep-Learning
---
This repository includes two researched projects created for a course in Deep-learning.
* "Gender Classification" presents a Logistic Regression & MLP models written with tensorflow v1
* "Rock Paper Scissors" presents a CNN & Hyperparameter from Keras
<br>
You can find more explanations regarding the projects in each folder.
<br>

**Course Goals:** <br>
Understanding the deep learning architecture, including working with images and series. <br>
A regression model in which a number is predicted and a classification model in which a class to which the item belongs is predicted. <br>
Basic concepts in natural language processing. <br>
The course is given at a level that is also compatible with graduate students.
