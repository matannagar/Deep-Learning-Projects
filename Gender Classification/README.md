* Logistic Regression 
* MLP
both are written with tensorflow V1

## Dataset
Using the Cardiovascular Disease dataset from Kaggle (provided in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset ) we will be trying to solve a classification problem. 

## The problem: 
Gender classification based on personâ€™s height, weight, age, whether he smokes or not.
How well will we be able to predict if a person is a male or a female based only on his phsycial attributes? 
## Divding the Dataset:
We will be splitting the dataset to 70% training and 30% testing as suggested in most common experiments of predicting a classifcation problems.
